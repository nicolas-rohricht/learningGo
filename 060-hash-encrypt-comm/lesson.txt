Hash, encryption and communication

Hash 
  A has algorithm is a mathematical function that takes in a variable-sized input
  such as a file or a message, and produces a fixed-size output, know as a hash or
  digest. The output is a unique representation of the input data, and even a small
  change tot he input data will produce a completely different hash value. Hash
  algorithms are used in a variety of applications such as data integrity checks,
  message authentication, password storage, and digital signatures. For example,
  when a user sets a password, the password is hashed and stored in a database.
  When the user logs in, the password they enter is hashed again and compared to
  the stored hash to verify their identity. Hash algorithms are designed to be 
  one-way functions, meaning it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to 
  reconstruct the original input data from the hash value. This makes them useful
  for securely storing passwords or sensitive information. Common examples of
  hash algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. However, it im
  important to note that some of these algotithms, particularly MD5 and SHA-1, are
  considered insecure and should not be used for new applications.

Encryption
  - Synchronous / symmetric encryption
    * singlekey
  - asynchronous encryption
    * public / private key
  
  Synchronous encryption and asynchronous encryption are two different 
  approaches to encrypting data. Synchronous encryption, also known as
  symmetric encryption, uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. This
  means that the same key is used to encrypt the data and to decrypt it. The
  encryption and decryption processes are fast and efficient, making Synchronous
  encryption a popular choice for encrypting large amounts of data. Examples of
  synchronous encryption algorithms incluse Advanced Encryption Standad (AES)
  and Data Encryption Standard (DES). Asynchronous encryption, also known as 
  public-key encryption, uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The
  public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt it.
  As a result, anyone can encrypt the data unsing the public key, but only the holder
  of the private key can decrypt it. asynchronous encryption is often used for 
  secure communication over insecure channels, such as the internet. Examples of
  asynchronous encryption algorithms include RSA and Elluptic Curve 
  Cryptography (ECC). Both synchronous and asynchronous encryption have their
  advantages and disadvantes, and the coice of which to use depends on the
  specific needs of the application. Synchronous encryption is tippically faster and
  more efficient for encrypting large amounts of data, while asynchronous
  encryption provides better security for secure communication over insecure
  channels.

Communication
  * simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex
  * simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex are terms used to describe different types of
  communication modes in telecommunications.
  
  * Simplex Communication: in simplex communication, information flows in only
  one direction. This means that the sender can transmit data to the receiver, but 
  the receiver cannot send data back to the sender. Examples of simplex
  communication include TV broadcasting and most remove control devices.

  * Half-Duplex Communication: In half-duplex communication information can
  flow in both directions, but not at the same time. When one party is transmitting
  data, the other party must wait for the transmission to end before sending their
  own data. Examples of half-duplex communication include walkie-talkies and CB 
  radios.

  * Full-Duplex Communication: In full-duplex communication, information can flow
  in both directions simultaneously. This means that both the sender and receiver
  can send and receive data at the same time. Examples of full-duplex
  communication include telephone conversations, video conferencing, and internet chat.

  - In summary, simplex communication is one-wa, half duplex communication is 
  two-way but not at the same time, and full-duplex communication is two-way and
  simultaneous.
